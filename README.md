Tokuu: AI-Powered Knitting Pattern Generator 🧶

Tokuu is an AI-driven project designed to generate detailed knitting patterns and charts based on user input. Currently in development, Tokuu enables users to:

✅ Describe a garment via text prompts (e.g., "grey longsleeve, size S, with Japanese-style shoulders") or upload an image of a knitted garment.
✅ Receive 5 AI-generated garment images based on the input.
✅ Select the closest match to refine the output.
✅ Generate a detailed knitting pattern and chart for the chosen design.

🚀 Goal: Simplify the knitting design process and make it accessible to creators of all skill levels. Stay tuned for updates! 🫶🏻
